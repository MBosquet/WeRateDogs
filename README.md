### Project Title
Understanding WeRateDogs: A first investigation into our favorite dog tweets!

### Project Description
This project is an investigation into the twitter archive of WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
The goal of this project is to gather data from different sources (provided file, programmatically downloaded file and file constructed via API) and formats (.csv, .tsv, .txt), assess the data's quality and tidiness and then clean it - all by using Python and its libraries. In the last step the cleaned data is analyzed to uncover insights from the data and create visualizations of these insights.

The datasets have been provided for analysis as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
